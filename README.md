# Metaheuristic-Based-ML-Models-for-Accurate-Battery-RUL-Prediction-in-Renewable-Energy-Storage-System
This project predicts lithium-ion battery RUL in renewable energy systems using ML models optimized with metaheuristics. Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM are tuned for accuracy. The Hawaii Natural Energy Institute dataset is used, with performance evaluated via RMSE and RÂ² scores.
